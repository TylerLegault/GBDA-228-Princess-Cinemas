      <h1>About Princess Cinemas</h1>
      <div class="aboutPageSections">
        <p>The Princess Cinemas is a true Canadian independent cinema, owner-operated and owner-programmed, with two urban locations in the heart of Waterloo, Ontario.</p>

        <hr class="smallHr">
          <h2>The 'Original' Princess Cinema</h2>
            <div class="aboutPC">
            <img class="aboutPics" src="../assets/images/PrincessOriginal.jpg" alt="Princess Original" width="" height="">
            <p class="aboutText">Our first location - a single screen cinema -  now called the Original Princess Cinema, was opened in 1985 at 6 Princess Street West, behind the Huether Hotel. The Original Princess Cinema still maintains a "calendar art-house" programming model, which exhibits the best in international, independent and Canadian cinema, as well as festival hits, documentaries, mini-festivals, Hollywood classics, cult films and special series. Audiences can expect eclectic programming at the Original Princess, and more mainstream bookings at the Princess Twin cinemas. The Original Princess also features our Live on Stage concert series. We publicize our offerings at the Original Princess Cinema with a bi-monthly newspaper guide, in addition to our web-site. The Original features comfortable high-back chairs and a truly funky, independent vibe. This 177-seat cinema is located on the second floor of an historic 19th century brewery building.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="twinTitle">Princess Twin Cinemas</h2>
            <div class="aboutPC">
            <img class="aboutPics" id="twinPic" src="../assets/images/PrincessTwin.jpg" alt="Princess Twin" width="280" height="">
            <p class="aboutText">In 2003, we spread our wings and purchased the Alan Rigby House of Furniture in Uptown Waterloo, and over the course of two years, converted the two-storey retail space to a twin cinema with stadium seating. Officially the Princess Twin cinemas started screening movies in January 2005. The Twin is just around the block from the Original at 46 King Street North. Unlike the Original Princess, the Twin Cinemas screen new choices every week and has the ability to hold popular hits for weeks, even months! Uptown Waterloo audiences get a chance to see a mix of quality, popular mainstream cinema, as well as fresh looks at new, specialty films at the Twin Cinemas. Some unique features of the Twin is its spacious lobby for receptions and parties, the <a href="http://princesscafe.ca/" target="_blank">Princess Cafe</a>, which offers the popular Dinner & a Movie combo, and the Odeon Gallery, which displays monthly exhibits by local artists.</p>

          <h2>What is a membership?</h2>
          <p>At the Princess Cinemas we value our customers. After all, they're the reason we're still around today. As a bonus for loyal customers, we offer a membership card that entitles the bearer to discounts at the box office.</p>
          <p>An annual membership costs $10 (tax included) and lasts for one year. During that year the card holder saves $4 at the box office every time they present their card. That means that once a member has come to more than 3 shows, the card has paid for itself, and is making the bearer money! In addition to box office benefits, we also offer members discounts at the snack bar and, from time to time, invitations to special sneak previews.</p>
          <p>Members also receive our printed film guide mailed direct to your home FREE of charge! Make sure you fill out the mailing list slip and drop it in the box in our lobbies of either location. You can also <a href="mailto:contact@princesscinemas.com">email us</a> your card number, expiry date and mailing address and we will get you on the mailing list.</p>
          <p class="randomSpacing">To become a member, just ask to buy a card the next time you're buying a ticket - you'll get the discount right away!</p>

      <div class="aboutPageSections">
        <p>Best NEW Parking area for Princess patrons are the 2 lots on adjacent corners at Regina and Bridgeport. FREE for 3 hours and close to either Princess Cinema.</p>
        <p>NEW! (as of Sept. 1, 2017) parking is FREE in all City surface lots after 5:00pm, including the Library lot.</p>
        <p>Note! During King St. construction - until Oct 2017 - there will be no street parking on King St. We encourage you to use the nearest lots at Regina & Bridgeport (TA & TB), Library (L), Dupont (D), Station Lot (S), Regina (R) and nearby street parking. Thank you for continuing to support the independent businesses in Uptown. We're in the home stretch!</p>
        <p>Monday to Friday between 8am and 6pm, on-street parking regulations permit FREE time-controlled parking for durations of one or two hours depending on the location.* On-street signage provides users with time-control limits. Longer-term paid parking is available in the centrally located UpTown Waterloo Parkade (P) for people who will be staying for a longer visit.* Most lots offer FREE parking after 5pm.</p>
        <p>Aside from all of the places right Uptown, we also suggest that you consider parking at the Sobey's/Walmart plaza and King & Bridgeport. You may think it is far away, but in reality, it is a 10-15 minute walk from there to either Princess Cinema.</p>
